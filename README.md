Car Purchase Amount Prediction (ANN Model)

This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict a customer’s car purchase amount based on demographic and financial features.
The dataset is preprocessed using MinMax scaling, and the model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras with multiple Dense layers.
The workflow includes data cleaning, normalization, model training, evaluation, and inverse scaling of predictions.
The final model can predict purchase amount for new customer inputs after normalization.
This project demonstrates end-to-end regression modeling using ANN in Python.
